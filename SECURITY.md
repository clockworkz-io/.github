# Security Policy

## Vulnerability Reporting

The security of our software is a top priority for Cloud Posse. We welcome reports on any security vulnerabilities discovered in any Cloud Posse-owned repository. All legitimate concerns will be promptly investigated and addressed.

When reporting a vulnerability, providing detailed information can greatly assist in the resolution process. Please try to include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential consequences.
- Detailed steps for reproducing the vulnerability.
- Information on any affected versions and configurations.
- Potential mitigations or workarounds you’ve identified.

### Response Expectations

> Our projects are open-source and released for free under a permissive license, with a focus on community contributions. We appreciate all contributions but do not offer compensation for security disclosures. This policy ensures fairness and equality within our community.

Upon submitting a vulnerability report, you can expect us to:
- Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
- Provide an assessment timeline for the vulnerability.
- Inform you once the issue has been addressed.

## Supported Project Versions

We typically support only the most recent major version of each project. Critical security updates may be backported to older versions at our discretion.

## Our Pledge

We deeply appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the broader community in enhancing our projects' security. Our approach to handling vulnerabilities is transparent and cooperative, recognizing and crediting individuals for their invaluable contributions to our documentation or public statements where suitable.

Your contributions are crucial in maintaining the security of Cloud Posse’s projects and the wider open-source community. Thank you for your support and dedication.
