Welcome to the Clockworkz Slack Community, part of the broader ecosystem of [Open Source Projects](https://github.com/clockworkz-io) Clockworkz, a [DevOps as a Sercvice](https://clockworkz.io/) based in EU. We're committed to fostering a collaborative, inclusive environment for engineers at all levels.

## Introduction

Our goal is to create a welcoming space for contributors from diverse backgrounds. This code outlines expectations for participation and the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We encourage everyone to contribute to making this a safe, positive community.

## Community Etiquette

- **Channel Selection**: Select the most appropriate channel for your questions; avoid cross-posting.
- **Professionalism**: Maintain workplace language standards and avoid profanity.
- **Positive Interactions**: Praise publicly, criticize constructively.
- **Empathy and Respect**: Exercise empathy, delicately correct others, and avoid sarcasm or demeaning remarks.
- **Understanding and Patience**: Seek to understand, not embarrass. Allow everyone to contribute to discussions.
- **Channel Topics**: Stick to the channel's topic and purpose.
- **Use of Channels**: Utilize `#random` for off-topic conversations and use threads for clarity.
- **Notifications**: Avoid using `@channel` and `@here` to respect everyone's time.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Discriminatory or offensive comments.
- Unwelcome, suggestive, or inappropriate usernames.
- Disrespectful or unprofessional conduct.
